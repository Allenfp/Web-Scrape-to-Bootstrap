# Scraping Websites

# [Demonstration Video (Youtube)](https://youtu.be/HHEvZdiXZUw)

The goal of this project was to create a tool that pulled relevant information from multiple web pages and transformed it into a single responsive mobile ready website.

For a picture of the final result, please navigate to the bottom of this README. 

### Known Issues:
* Should open multiple browsers in parallel rather than in sequence for faster execution of web scraping. 

### Libraries: 
Pandas, Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Flask, MongoDB, Bootstrap.
